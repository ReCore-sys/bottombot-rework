# Plans
Imma just list ideas n shit here, IDK if i'll actually do em but i'll try<br>
### My Plans
- [ ] Add a search command so people can look for companies
  - [ ] Add fuzzy search
  - [ ] Add parameter search (search if stock price is under $10, avg price is above $80, ect)
- [ ] Allow people to sell custom stuff. This could be stuff like the following:
  * Custom scripts to mine crypto (Will need a fake psudeo language for that, maybe .bb files?)
  * Decorative items (Badges, banners, ect)
- [ ] CaH game
- [ ] Reminder command
